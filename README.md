## Description of the project:

The aim of this paper is to discuss the uses of the bootstrap method in the field of data analysis and to show its practical application on the example of improving size performance of the Toda-Yamamoto test for Granger causality in asymptotic version. The practical research area includes trivariate integrated and cointegrated VAR models. The null hypothesis rejection percentage of the Toda-Yamamoto test based on the standard asymptotic distribution is compared to the null hypothesis rejection percentage of the same test using the bootstrap method based on leveraged residuals. Various types of distributions of error terms are considered. The impact on the results of parameters such as lag parameter and number of bootstrap replications is analyzed. In most cases, the use of bootstrap leads to an improvement in the size performance of the TY test. However, it is not an universal tool and in specific cases its use leads to a size distortion of the results obtained for the standard asymptotic theory.
